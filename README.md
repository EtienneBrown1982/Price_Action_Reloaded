The models will be able to predict the trading range for the upcoming day.

## Regression Models and Generative AI model
Can the models determine the high and low for tomorrow?



## LSGAN Model
Gaussian Noise is generated from a normal distribution, a common approach for generating random numbers that mimic many natural phenomena due to the Central Limit Theorem.

Random Walk Noise is a cumulative sum of the Gaussian Noise over an axis. This process simulated a random walk, a common model in finance for price movement. 

Sequential model because of (1) good with multiple inputs/outputs, shared layers, and non-linear topology (residual connections). Sequential model is a linear stack of layers. This is also suitable for initial explorations.

testing against real data.
